## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This was Cloned from GitHub Invoice Pagination WORKING at 9:20 AM 11/24/2023. Because this is the direcotry linked to ,my vercel database and GIT repository, I am not goig to screw with regenerating the remote. repository. From now forward Git repositiry syncs will need to be done with git push origin Head:master. I deleted and remade this directory with a git clone. I will now push this version back with the commit comment 'Newly cloned. Still HEAD. only README.nd changed'

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.
